      <h2>Don't miss</h2>
      <p>Many people have heard of Rio's Botanical Gardens, which regularly come in third on city must-see lists, after the Christ statue and Sugarloaf Mountain. Few, however, venture a little farther down the same road to the spectacular Parque Lage. Nestled in the shadow of Corcovado, the park consists of a slightly ramshackle but charming tropical garden, originally laid out by the English landscaper John Tyndale and including touches of British romanticism, such as a Baroque folly and grotto that somehow don‚Äôt seem out of place in the midst of Rio‚Äôs exuberant rain forest. The crowning glory is an Italianate villa, which today is home to a visual-arts school and an excellent caf√©‚Äîone of the most delightful places in the city for breakfast or afternoon tea.</p>

      <h2>Most underrated place</h2>
      <p>Most travelers come to Rio for the beach and party scene and don't even consider the amazing rainforest nearby. Visit Floresta Tijuca, said to be the world's largest urban forest, for hiking, waterfalls, and monkeys‚Äîall right in the middle of the city.</p>

      <h2>Big thrill</h2>
      <p>Rio is one of the most spectacular cities in the world to see from above, but there's no need to fork out the big bucks for a helicopter ride; try your hand at a spot of hang gliding to enjoy the same bird's-eye view while you gently ride the thermals 1,500 feet above the city‚Äôs Tijuca rain forest.
        Bragging rights
        For those after the full Carnaval experience without necessarily visiting during Carnaval, Paul can arrange for a private show by one of Rio's top samba schools at any time of year; this can even take place in the villa that used to belong to samba legend Elis Regina (which is off-limits to the public), adding an invaluable historical background to the evening.
        Famous Brazilian contemporary artist Marcos Chaves will serve as your host for a day of private viewings at galleries and studios, where you'll meet some of the artists, curators, and gallery owners that are part of Rio's flourishing art scene. If you're already a collector, this is a chance to get ahead of the curve and spot the next big thing.
        Paul has an exclusive arrangement with the bar halfway up Sugarloaf: They rope off a section of the mountain overlooking Copacabana while their top barman leads you through a private master-class in the art of making the perfect caipirinha, Brazil's national cocktail.</p>
